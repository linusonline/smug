Player's action gauge doesn't appear until player is within line of sight of a monster, OR until player attacks.
    Line of sight = some triangular area in front of monster.
    When monsters are attacked, they immediately turn to face the player.
When player moves out of line of sight of monsters, there is a short delay until action gauge disappears.
    Monsters are programmed to keep the player within their line of sight if they can.
When action gauge appears, it is full.
